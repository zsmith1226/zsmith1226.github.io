	<br>(1)Which language was used and explain your choice and feel of the language?
	<br>I chose javascript. I do not have any prior experience, but after reading resources
	<br>online and self practice with the syntax, I was able to create my the RDR correctly.
	
	<p></p>
	
	<p>
		<br>(2)Share useful learning resource for our implementation in this assignment.
		<br>The resources that I used included:
		<br><A HREF="http://www.w3schools.com/js/">w3schools.com</A>
		<br><A HREF="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/try_javascript_online.php">JS Compiler</A>
		<br><A HREF="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow.com</A>
		
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<br>(3)List additional suggestions/contributions for learning community
		<br>When creating my RDR, I found it very helpful that I had made a logically correct
		<br>pseudocode back in PL Asst 1. I felt I would have spent more time if the pseudocode
		<br>were incorrect or if I did not have it all. That being said, I would suggest
		<br>that even though it might not be necessary for some, that pseudocode, or diagrams
		<br>be made to assist with coding until more experience is gained.
